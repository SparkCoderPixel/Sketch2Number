# Sketch2Number


DigitDrawAI (a.k.a Sketch2Number) is an interactive Python application that lets you draw digits (0–9 or multi-digit numbers) with your mouse and instantly predicts them using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.

The project includes:

🖌️ Drawing Pad GUI (Tkinter) – draw with your mouse, erase, clear, and adjust brush size.

🤖 Real-time AI predictions – predictions update automatically as you draw.

🔢 Multi-digit recognition – write numbers like “10”, “2025”, “12345” and the model will segment & recognize each digit.

📊 Confidence scores – shows probabilities for each digit (top-3 per segment).

⚡ GPU/CPU support – runs on CUDA if available, falls back to CPU.

Perfect for:

Learning how deep learning models (CNNs) recognize handwriting.

Exploring real-time AI applications with Tkinter.

Fun mini-projects or demos for AI beginners.
